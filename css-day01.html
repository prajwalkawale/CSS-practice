        <p>GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple
            people
            make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time
            collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.</p><br>

        <p>Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system
            used to
            handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code,
            enabling
            multiple developers to work together on non-linear development</p>
