    <h1>The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions</h1><br>
    <h2>GROUPING</h2>
    <h3><u>In the bottom of page text is not included in grouping selectors</u></h3>
    <p>It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.


        To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.</p><br>
    <p>The CSS grouping selector is used to select multiple elements and style them together. This reduces the code and
        extra effort to declare common styles for each element. To group selectors, each selector is separated by a
        space.</p><br>
    <em>THIS IS ONLY CSS GROUPING SELECTOR PRACTICE</em><br>
    <div>The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The div tag is used as a container for
        HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The div tag is easily
        styled by using the class or id attribute. Any sort of content can be put inside the div tag!
